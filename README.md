## Create a CRA proyect

```bash
$ npx create-react-app my-proyect
$ cd my-proyect
```


## Git configs

Set user and email local configurations

```bash 
$ git config --local user.name "user name"
$ git config --local user.email "user@email.com"
```
When using multiple accounts of git, remember to clear credentials.
First of all, we'll check if we have a credential manager working.

```bash
$ git credential-manager version
```

### For clearing them in windows:

* Open credential manager
* Clear github saved credentials

### fixing author of commit

```bash
$ git commit --amend --author="<userName> <userEmail>" --no-edit
```

Setting our remote repositories

```bash
$ git add remote origin <remoteRepoURL>
```

## GH-pages dependency

Install (GH-pages)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages] as a global dependency in your working station.

```bash
$ npm i gh-pages
```

## Update package.json

We'll be adding a **homepage** key to our package.json file.
We have to add our gh-pages URL pairing to that homepage key.

> homepage = `https://${githubUserName}.github.io/${repositoryName} 

```json
{
  "homepage": "https://<userName>.github.io/<repositoryName>",
}

In addition, we'll be adding this two scripts for automating our deploy in just one click

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
    }
}

```

### deploy script

Here we are running gh-pages CLI command to publish our distribution to be served by github.
With the **-d** flag we are indicating to use the **/build** folder as the point of entrance of our gh-pages-served Application.
If you are familiar with [CRA](https://en.reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html), you'll notice that is the famouse production bundle that webpack spits out when running

```bash
$ npm run build
```

### predeploy script

That is why we added our **predeploy** key earlier.
This will run immediately before than [deploy](###deploy-script).


## Workflow

1. manage changes in master branch
1. add and commit changes
1. execute

```bash 
$ npm run deploy
```

By now, gh-pages package must have created a gh-pages branch and feeded it with our production build.

1. Navigate to our package.json [homepage-key](##update-package.json) value
1. You should visualize your div (#root) displayed on the viewport üòéüëç
